# Setting up my blog

## Understanding my needs
Blogging is not something that is new to me. I've been creating, customizing,
and working with Wordpress blogs for a very long time. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
, on the other hand is a completely different beast. Wordpress has tons of
amazing features, some of which I had found very useful in the past (for
example: creating highly dynamic pages for visitors to interact with the site).
This blog will focus mainly on my thoughts and learnings as I progress through
[@gSchool](https://twitter.com/gschool). Therefore, I decided to go with Jekyll
this time around. It is easily integrated with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/),
and there is a ton of [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) available on the web.

## Setting up Jekyll
There could not have been an easier process than the one that I chose.
I used [jekyllbootstrap's](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html)
guide to set up my blog on Github Pages. It only took me about **10 minutes**.
Once it was set up on Github, I edited the config file to include my information.
Anytime I want to add a post, all I need to do is `rake post title="titlename"`
and then add, commit and push and it's on my github page, ~10 minutes later.

## Looking forward
There's still a *TON* that I need to learn and things that I want to do to make
this blog something that I'm proud of. Some of which are:

1. Learn YAML.
2. Set up analytics (Mixpanel, GA, etc).
3. Edit the theme / find a better one.
4. Write a blog post about gSchool (currently in my 4th week).
