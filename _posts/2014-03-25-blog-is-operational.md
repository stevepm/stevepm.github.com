# Setting up my blog

## Understanding my needs
Blogging is not something that is new to me. I've been creating, customizing,
and working with Wordpress blogs for a very long time. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
, on the other hand is a completely different beast. Wordpress has tons of
amazing features, some of which I had found very useful in the past (for
example: creating highly dynamic pages for visitors to interact with the site).
This blog will focus mainly on my thoughts and learnings as I progress through
[@gSchool](https://twitter.com/gschool). Therefore, I decided to go with Jekyll
this time around. It is easily integrated with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/),
and there is a ton of [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) available on the web.

## Setting up Jekyll
This could not be an easier process.
